# account_sync_sidecar

A side-car to provide ldap access to DLS containers

This is where you should write a short paragraph that describes what your module does,
how it does it, and why people should use it.

Source          | <https://github.com/DiamondLightSource/account-sync-sidecar>
:---:           | :---:
Docker          | `docker run ghcr.io/diamondlightsource/account-sync-sidecar:latest`
Releases        | <https://github.com/DiamondLightSource/account-sync-sidecar/releases>

This is where you should put some images or code snippets that illustrate
some relevant examples. If it is a library then you might put some
introductory code here:

```python
from account_sync_sidecar import __version__

print(f"Hello account_sync_sidecar {__version__}")
```

Or if it is a commandline tool then you might put some example commands here:

```
python -m account_sync_sidecar --version
```
